Hospital Management System 
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a decentralized platform designed to streamline and enhance hospital operations using blockchain and Node.js. This system facilitates secure and transparent management of patient records, doctor appointments, medical billing, and inventory tracking without relying on a central authority. By leveraging smart contracts, the system ensures tamper-proof patient records, automated billing, and seamless interaction between hospitals, doctors, and patients. The use of blockchain enhances data security, interoperability, and privacy, eliminating the risks associated with centralized databases. Built with Node.js for scalability and efficiency, this project offers a robust, efficient, and trustless approach to modern healthcare management.
